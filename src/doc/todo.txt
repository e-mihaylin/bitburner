global:
- migrate to typescript files
- add types
- use ns.getMoneySources?
- rm singleton (8gb), manage from player
- monitor of running (not shared) scripts
- auto backup once a day/hour
- use storage (storage events?), files, ports (queues)?
- port usage: hack/grow/weaken info
- split utils to lower ram

  // const unlocked = {
  //   darkweb: ns.hasTorRouter(),
  //   stock: ns.stock.has4SDataTIXAPI(), // ToDo: market api levels
  //   go: !!ns.go,
  //   formulas: !!ns.formulas,
  //   singularity: !!ns.singularity,
  //   gang: ns.gang.inGang(),
  // };

scan:
iterate all hosts:
- search and solve cct
- if not all ports open, use cracks
- if not root, use nuke
- if not all lit, search lit
- if not backdoored, backdoor
- skip if target,
- skip if target, if nuked, can hack, has money, push to targets
- skip if attacker, if nuked, has ram, so scp, push to attackers

player:
- unlocks tracking
- money management
- early game scripts versions (low mem), switch on events, singularity versions
- port writing
- global state objects
- coordinate attack mode
- coordinate purchase/hashnet/hashes
- coordinate market
- coordinate servers purchase
- coordinate share
- coordinate search
- coordinate attackers/targets/purchased (use utils), write to ports, use caches
- coordinate exploit (track SF)
- coordinate augmenets
- coordinate programs/darknet
- coordinate factions/conditions/reputations/favor
- coordinate augmenets/install/backups
- coordinate hacking/univercity/strategies
- coordinate money/crimes
- coordinate home upgrades
- low/high memory versions
- implement singularity without singularity
- use singularity
- use getBitNodeMultipliers
- all document using methods to 1 file, use getters (ram?) or port commands
- full early game automate
- full end game automate

analyze:
- improve scoring (money ok, hacking ok, time not ok)
- clear unused stats (avg), global info

attack:
- scan for new targets/attakers, kill shared, prepare, batch
- write actual income per sec/ram after prepare
- auto increase hackPercent if free ram OR
- use multiple batches against 1 target
- use hack vs stocks info
- add circleRam, circleTime to analyze stats
- calc prepare time (console.time)
- mode switch from player
- prepare to separate file?
- separate xp script
- add best xp to analyze (ns.getServer(h).baseDifficulty / ns.getWeakenTime(h))

utils:
- fetch all data only once
- listen port data
- send port data
- JSON.stringify(, null, 2) -> utils
- use caches for utils lists, invalidate caches by server sell/purchase (use ports)
- utilize less ram on document

exploit:
- better dev menu
- automate alter reality
- automate edit
- automate megabyteburner
- automate n00dles

go:
- improve strategies by filters
- move scoring/decisions
- check best scripts
- use cheats

hacknet:
- simple/hashnet versions
- better hashnet logic (predict outcome)
- upgrade caches depending on hashes max price
- smart version - calculate upgrade pay itself time
(first - by hashes sell to money, second - by target money grow, weaken, etc)

hashes:
- all hashes upgrades automate
- move to hacknet?
- send event on server money/security change

hud:
- better targets (maxed targets/attacked targets/backdoored/all)
- better attackers (owned/rooted/known)
- better incomes (market? hashnet?)
- corporations?
- go stats?
- factions?

market:
- automate without 4sigma data (for bitnode 8)
- port writing
- profit per sec
- manage from player.js

purchase:
- auto stopPurchase manage (from player?)

search:
- click focus (if no aug) after search, search from focus
- write contracts to out file
- solver cleanup
- backdoor separate?
- spawn lit grabber?
- spawn cct solver?
- spawn backdoor?
- all spawns from player?


sell:
- get shortUnlock from player.js

share-all:
- rename?
- params from player
- all free space after batch attacks

gangs:
- cleanup code, tasks
- dont puy hacking upgrades for combat gangs
- support hacking gangs

corporation:
- todo

bladeburners:
- todo

sleeves:
- todo

stanek:
- todo

infiltrate:
- automate

startup:
- create program BruteSSH.exe (todo) focus
- run attack.js simple
- do crime? mug? larceny? (todo) focus
- build 1st money, buy 1st hacknet (~34k)
- if int create program AutoLink.exe  focus
- if int create program DeepscanV1.exe focus
- if int create program ServerProfiler.exe focus
- store money, buy home ram (~10m -> 31.862m -> 100.684m)
- run startup (go, purchase, hashes, hacknet, attack, se)
- enter factions, travel
- run share
- do rep (focus)
- spend money
- store money ? when
- store money, buy home ram (?)
- build up 300+m, run sell
- spend money
- store money ? when
- store money, buy home ram (?)
- build up 31,2b, buy stock api (todo), run m, run hud
- buy augmentations (unfocus)
- wait for 100+TB, run attack.js not simple
- make -54k karma, kills
